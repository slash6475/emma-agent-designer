1. Purpose
===========

  JFern package provides simple framework for Petri Net modelling
  and simulations. It gives the programmer  a Petri Net simulator 
  fully integrated with the Java programming language.


2. How to install it
=====================

  The package and related utilities are distributed in binary form 
  as a jar file, which should be simply placed in the classpath of 
  your application.  Refer to the javadoc generated API help files 
  for more information about the API to the library.

  The distribution also contains aditional dynamic compiler utility
  library, which is LGPLed: compiler.jar
  
  To run examples with the dynamic compiler, you need to have 
  tools.jar from your Java distribution (see your jdkXXX/lib/tools.jar) 
  which is copyrighted by Sun Microsystems either:
    - in your classpath
    - in the ext directory of your JDK (extensions)
    - in the lib directory of the JFern distribution
  
  
  To run JFern Net Toolbox application, simply use:
  
      java -jar rakiura-jfern.jar
  
  
  or in your IDE environment add all the JARs from lib into your CLASSPATH, 
  and use as the entry class:
  
      java org.rakiura.cpn.gui.NetToolboxApplication 
  
  
  

3. Building it from sources
============================

  To build the library yourself you need to have a customized 
  software package: ANT.
 
  ANT is a  java-based build tool produced as a part of
  Jakarta Apache project.      
  You can download the ANT version from:
  http://nzdis.otago.ac.nz/download/software/ant.tar.gz
  Unpack it and follow the instructions how to install it.

  The above package was modified by us, and the  original
  software from ANT effort might not work for you "out of 
  the box",  we suggest you use our provided  and patched 
  version.


  Once you have ANT installed and ready, simply type:
    ant jar
  to generate classes and pack them into a jar file. The jar file 
  by default will be placed inside lib directory.


4. Testing
===========

  The framework will allow you to perform built-in tests, but you
  need to have installed JUnit testing framework. If you have junit.jar 
  in your classpath (which can be obtained from: 
     http://waitaki.otago.ac.nz/download/software/junit.jar)
  you can simply type:
     ant testall
  and it will perform all buil-in testing suites. 

  To test the dynamic compiler, copy the tools.jar from your JDK
  to the lib of JFern, and run a Booking example as:
  
      java -classpath lib/rakiura-jfern.jar org.rakiura.cpn.example.booking.BookingTest biking swimming skiing

  or, having lib/rakiura-jfern.jar in your classpath, just:
  
      java org.rakiura.cpn.example.booking.BookingTest biking swimming skiing
