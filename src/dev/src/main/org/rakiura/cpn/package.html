An object-oriented hierarchical Coloured Petri Net implementation.

Different places can be fused, so that tokens entering or exiting a place is also entering and exiting in the other places. 
Coloured tokens can be any java-class. Nets are saved as XML documents. 
The nets can be simulated and time can be included as well. 
The package {@link org.rakiura.cpn.gui} Provides a GUI to draw, show, edit, simulate etc. the Petri nets.
